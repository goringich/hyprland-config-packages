Put your per-theme images here and name them exactly as your ZSH_THEME, e.g.:

  ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme  ->  ~/.config/fastfetch/theme-images/agnoster.png
  ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/robbyrussell.zsh-theme -> ~/.config/fastfetch/theme-images/robbyrussell.png

Then run:
  ~/.config/fastfetch/link-zsh-theme-image.sh

This will update ~/.config/fastfetch/current-theme.png symlink, which you can use in fastfetch logo.source.
